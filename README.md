Our main objective is to predict the wine quality using machine learning using python programming language.A large dataset is considered and wine quality is modelled to analyse the quality of wine through different parameters like fixed acidity,volatile acidity etc.All these parameters will be analysed through machine learning algorithms like random forest classifier algorithm,decision tree algorithm and linear regression.
